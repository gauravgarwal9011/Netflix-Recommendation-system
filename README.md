# üé¨ Netflix Recommendation System Using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
## üîé Project Overview

This Netflix Recommendation System is built using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to recommend movies based on users' past ratings. The SVD technique is a matrix factorization method that decomposes the large user-item interaction matrix into latent factors. This helps identify patterns between users and movies, enabling the system to predict unseen ratings and recommend movies to users.

The engine also employs Cosine Similarity to find similar users and recommend movies that similar users have liked. It is designed to improve personalized content delivery on streaming platforms like Netflix.
## üßë‚Äçüíª Techniques & Libraries Used
### Key Techniques:

- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): A collaborative filtering technique to decompose the user-item interaction matrix.
- Cosine Similarity: To calculate the similarity between users based on their ratings.
- Matrix Factorization: To extract hidden features that can predict missing ratings.

### Libraries:

- Python: The core language for the implementation.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and handling.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Scikit-learn: For SVD and other machine learning algorithms.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: For data exploration and analysis.
- Numpy: For efficient numerical computation.

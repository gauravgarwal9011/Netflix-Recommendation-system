## üîé Project Overview


This Netflix Recommendation System is built using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to recommend movies based on users' past ratings. The SVD technique is a matrix factorization method that decomposes the large user-item interaction matrix into latent factors. This helps identify patterns between users and movies, enabling the system to predict unseen ratings and recommend movies to users.

The engine also employs Cosine Similarity to find similar users and recommend movies that similar users have liked. It is designed to improve personalized content delivery on streaming platforms like Netflix.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Techniques & Libraries Used
### Key Techniques:

- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): A collaborative filtering technique to decompose the user-item interaction matrix.
- Cosine Similarity: To calculate the similarity between users based on their ratings.
- Matrix Factorization: To extract hidden features that can predict missing ratings.

### Libraries:

- **Python**: The core language for the implementation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For SVD and other machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data exploration and analysis.
- **Numpy**: For efficient numerical computation.

## üí° Key Insights

- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) enables the reduction of dimensionality of the user-item matrix, making it easier to identify hidden factors that drive preferences and ratings.
- Cosine Similarity helps in finding similar users by comparing their rating patterns.
- The system provides personalized movie recommendations based on users‚Äô historical data.

### Strengths:

- The model can recommend movies that a user has never watched before but is likely to enjoy, based on the preferences of similar users.
- SVD works well with large datasets, providing scalability for platforms like Netflix.

### Limitations:

- The model assumes that all data (user ratings) are complete, which can lead to less accurate recommendations when data is sparse.
- SVD can be computationally expensive for extremely large datasets without further optimizations.
